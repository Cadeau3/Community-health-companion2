## ⭐ Why I Built This  
As a caregiver for my grandmother, I often struggled to find simple, trustworthy health information when I needed it most. That experience inspired me to build a tool that could help others facing similar challenges.  
This project shows how technology can support real people in everyday life, especially within communities where information access is limited.
